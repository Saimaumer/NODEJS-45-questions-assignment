//Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

//let car = 'subaru';

//console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

//console.log(car == 'subaru')

// • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

// • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.

let condition1 = 7;

let condition2 =5;
 //test 1
 console.log("test 1: condition1 is equal to condition1");
 console.log(condition1 == 7);


 //test 2
 console.log ("\ntest 2: condition2 is equal to 5?");
 console.log (condition2 == 5);


 //test 3
 console.log ("\ntest 3: condition1 is not equal to condition2 ");
 console.log(condition1 != condition2);

 //test 4
 console.log("\n test 4 : condition1 is less than condition2");
 console.log(condition1 < condition2);


 //test 5
 console.log("\n test 5 : condition1 is greater than condition2");
 console.log(condition1 > condition2);


//test 6

console.log(condition1 >condition2);

//test 7
console.log("\n test 7 : condition2 is greater than condition1");
console.log(condition2 > condition1 );



//test 8
console.log("\n test 8 : condition2 is not equal to  condition2");

console.log("\n test 9 : condition2 is less than condition1");
